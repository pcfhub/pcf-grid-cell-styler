/**
 * How each column type behaves once the cell *is* being edited.
 *
 * The contract is small and every part of it matters:
 *
 *   - `props.onChange(value)` stages a value. It does not commit one, and it
 *     does not close the editor.
 *   - `params.stopEditing()` commits and closes; `params.stopEditing(true)`
 *     discards and closes. An editor that never calls it is an editor the user
 *     cannot leave.
 *   - `props.charPress` is the keystroke that opened the cell, if the user
 *     started typing rather than clicking. Ignoring it swallows that first
 *     character, which reads as dropped input — and *displaying* it without
 *     also staging it is a different bug with the same ending, see below.
 *   - `props.secured` is field-level security, not disablement. A secured cell
 *     is one this user may not write, and an override that ignores it hands
 *     them a working editor for a value the save will reject.
 *   - The grid may unmount an editor at any time. Nothing here may hold state
 *     that has to be flushed on the way out.
 *
 * Only the types with something to add are overridden. Everything else falls
 * through to the grid's own editor, which already knows how to edit a lookup,
 * a date or an option set against real metadata — none of which a customizer
 * is handed.
 *
 * Each override is a thin, pure function returning one element; the behaviour
 * lives in the components below. That split is not decoration. The grid calls
 * these functions repeatedly for the same cell and requires them to be pure,
 * so anything that has to exist *once per open editor* — a focus call, a
 * one-shot latch, the staging of `charPress` — cannot live in the function
 * body. It has to live somewhere tied to the mount, which is what a component
 * with hooks gives us. The elements are rendered by the host's React instance
 * (see the manifest's platform-library note), so hooks inside them dispatch
 * through the same instance the grid is using.

 * again for a cell that is already editing; a closure made per *call* starts
 * over at `false` and hands React fresh handlers, so an Escape followed by a
 * re-render followed by the blur commits after all — the bug the latch exists
 * to prevent, restored by the way the latch was built. A ref survives the
