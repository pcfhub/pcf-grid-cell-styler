/**
 * How each column type behaves once the cell *is* being edited.
 *
 * The contract is small and every part of it matters:
 *
 *   - `props.onChange(value)` stages a value. It does not commit one, and it
 *     does not close the editor.
 *   - `params.stopEditing()` commits and closes; `params.stopEditing(true)`
 *     discards and closes. An editor that never calls it is an editor the user
 *     cannot leave.
 *   - `props.charPress` is the keystroke that opened the cell, if the user
 *     started typing rather than clicking. Ignoring it swallows that first
 *     character, which reads as dropped input.
 *   - `props.secured` is field-level security, not disablement. A secured cell
 *     is one this user may not write, and an override that ignores it hands
 *     them a working editor for a value the save will reject.
 *   - The grid may unmount an editor at any time. Nothing here may hold state
 *     that has to be flushed on the way out.
 *
 * Only the types with something to add are overridden. Everything else falls
 * through to the grid's own editor, which already knows how to edit a lookup,
 * a date or an option set against real metadata — none of which a customizer
 * is handed.
